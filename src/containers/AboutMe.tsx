        <Typography variant="h3">I grew up in Chicago and recently graduated with a Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern. 
        During my time in college, I got interested in Computer Science my junior year and developed an interest for it. This interest has led me to venture towards a different career path and pursue a career as a Full-Stack Developer. I have no idea what lies ahead, but I have taken the first steps through projects and self-studying. I have recently finished my internship at Relayr as a Full-Stack Dev and grew a passion for web-dev. I decided I want to learn more about this profession, and follow my heart and intuition. After all, they somehow already know what you truly want to become ðŸ˜„. Everything else is secondary. </Typography>
